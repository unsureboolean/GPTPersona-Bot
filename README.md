# GPTPersona-Bot
### Persona Impersonating Discord Bot

## Features

### Switch Persona
* Currently a Robert California bot, but more persona's can easily be added in the personas.py file. Make sure add the persona to the bot.py file by adding the name and value you've assigned *app_commands.Choice(name="Persona Name/Label", value="yourPersonaValue")*

* /switchpersona: Switch between personas
   * `Robert California`: The man himself
   * `Lizard King`: Robert, evolved
   * `Sigma`: Epic Storyteller
   * `Socrates`: The wise one?
   * 'Dwight Schrute': Beet farmer, paper salesman
   * `random`: Picks a random persona
   * 'More personas to be added later'

* `/private` Robert will switch to private mode
* `/public` Robert will switch to public mode
* `/replyall` Robert will reply to the masses
* `/reset` Clear conversation history
* `/chat-model` Switch to different chat model
   * `OFFICIAL-GPT-3.5`: GPT-3.5-turbo model
   * `OFFICIAL-GPT-4.0`: GPT-4.0 model should work for those who have this available, I have not tested yet




### Mode

* `public mode (default)`  RobGPT California directly replies on the channel to targeted chats

* `private mode` RobGPT's reply can only be seen by the person who used the command

* `replyall mode` RobGPT will reply to all messages in the channel without using slash commands


# Setup

## Prerequisites to install

* run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```


## Step 1: Create a Discord bot

1. Go to Discord's developer portal and create a bot (Instructions for this everywhere, it's easy)

2. Get the Discord bot's token (Store this somewhere safe)

3. In the .env file, set the token as the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` variable

4. Turn on all Intents in developer portal on discord


## Step 2: OpenAI API authentication

### Get your OpenAI API key
1. Sign up for a Developer Account on openai.com

2. Generate a new API key (Store this too)

3. In the .env file, set your OpenAI API key as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with no quotes or trailing lines


## Step 3: Run RobGPT on the desktop (Command line)

1. Open a terminal, command prompt, powershell, etc.

2. Navigate to the directory where you installed the RobGPT.

3. Type `python main.py` to start the bot


### The Lizard King does not eat bugs. Please report them.

   > **Bugs**
   > - Robert will reply to everything in replyall mode.  Make sure you turn on slowdown mode in discord because he will stop responding if he gets more requests before he has answered the last one.~~ *Implemented a messaging queue, it throws an error but it works.*
   > - Robert will occasionally forget he is Robert.  This is ok, it happens to everyone from time to time.  You may need to /reset, especially if someone has asked him to be someone else.
   > - ~~When changing modes or after a reset, Robert will exit /replyall mode but will not mention anything about it. You need to turn it off and back on to get his attention. I will adjust the message when I get time.~~ *Fixed*
     > - This introduced a bug where Robert will sometimes take longer to reply (about 20-30 seconds). Leaving it for now as it is only occasional but it needs to be investigated.
   > - When messages get queued, RobGPT throws an error.  The messages go through as one message usually, RobGPT throws an error, but then usually responds to both messages as if they were one prompt.


   > **Future implementations:**
   > - Get RobGPT to change his nickname in the server whenever he changes personas
   > - Get RobGPT to be able to remember session ID for chat instances so that each persona could have their own thread
   > - Find a way for RobGPT to operate independently in each server.  Not sure if this is possible without a new API for each server.
   > - Docker support
   > - Support for GPT4All and other LLM repositories
   > - Build in feedback command for machine learning (/feedback :thumbsup: and /feedback :thumbsdown:
